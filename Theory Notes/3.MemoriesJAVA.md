# Types of Memory in Java

## Stack Memory

- **What it is:** This is where Java stores method calls and local variables (variables declared inside a method).
- **Why it's used:** Stack memory is used to keep track of the point to return to after a method finishes execution and to store variables that are only needed inside that method.
- **Example:** When you call a method, a "stack frame" is created to hold its local variables and the method's execution state. Once the method completes, this frame is removed.

## Heap Memory

- **What it is:** This is where Java stores objects created with the `new` keyword and their instance variables.
- **Why it's used:** Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation, meaning objects that need to persist beyond the execution of a single method are stored here.
- **Example:** If you create an object like `Car myCar = new Car();`, the `Car` object is stored in heap memory.

## Method Area (or Metaspace in modern Java)

- **What it is:** This is a part of the heap where class definitions, static variables, and constants are stored.
- **Why it's used:** The method area is used to store data that is shared among all instances of a class, such as static variables and methods.
- **Example:** If a class `Vehicle` has a static variable `maxSpeed`, this variable is stored in the method area.

## PC (Program Counter) Register

- **What it is:** Each thread in Java has its own PC register, which keeps track of the next instruction to execute.
- **Why it's used:** The PC register helps the JVM keep track of where each thread is in its execution sequence.
- **Example:** If a thread is executing a loop, the PC register helps it know which iteration of the loop it's currently on.

## Native Method Stack

- **What it is:** This memory area is used to support native methods (methods written in languages other than Java, like C or C++).
- **Why it's used:** Native methods can interact with the underlying system in ways that Java itself cannot, so this stack is used to handle these operations.
- **Example:** If a Java program calls a C function using JNI (Java Native Interface), the native method stack is used.
